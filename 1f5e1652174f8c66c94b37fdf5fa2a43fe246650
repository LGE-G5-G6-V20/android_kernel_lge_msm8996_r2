      "message": "@Georg: Can you double check this? CVE-2023-33063 is in the Dec ASB. Although it would apply (almost) cleanly I checked the code logic and found missing locking without which that change would introduce races in that newly added ref counter.\n\nSo I picked the relevant other patches to make the last one apply cleanly and make sense given the locking used. I grouped them into a topic to make it visible that those others are basically a precondition for the CVE fix.",
