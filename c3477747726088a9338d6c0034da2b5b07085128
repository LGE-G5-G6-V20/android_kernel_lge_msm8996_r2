      "message": "The actual fix of this topic is in the 2 Bluetooth patches fixing an OOB read (hdev-\u003ename could be less than 8 chars). The first fix introduced another OOB (write IIRC) issue which the 2nd fixes. The string-patches are required for the 2nd fix. I also submitted this patchset to CIP with those commit messages (except the Change-Id of course)\n\nShall I still change the titles? I mean pretty much any commit to this kernel is a backport as 4.4 doesn\u0027t get any updates/fixes from upstream, so I don\u0027t see a reason to add that prefix.",
