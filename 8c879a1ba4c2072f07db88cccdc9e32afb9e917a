      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand. Currently I push those independent changes separately and as I find them. So if one is wrong or needs discussion it won\u0027t block the others. And Gerrit keeps track of them. Only the wireguard update consists of multiple commits on top of each other (is that what you meant by \"in a chain\"?) and in an own topic.\nDo you prefer to submit all/most changes from 1 branch? There might be more changes coming any time while I work through hundreds of merge conflicts and I thought I\u0027ll submit ASAP what I already found instead of waiting till I\u0027m done and submitting a large amount of changes. \n\nBtw: what about the 18/19 branches? I actually found those while trying to merge my local and the lineage-18.1 branch but only the 20 seems to have activity on Gerrit. Hence me pushing that to 20.",

      "message": "yeah, on top of each other is what i mean by chain. unless you mean to merge only this one, cause afaics you added me only to this one, so never quite sure which ones you deem ready. lots of people upload commits that are either not ready to be reviewed/merged.\nso ideally, post them in a chain (or add a topic, or add reviewers to all of the commits you want to get merged), and the ones you think are ready should at least get a verified+1 from you, then we know we can take a look at them. rebasing them or picking them out of a chain is not a problem.",
